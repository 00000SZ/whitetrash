=====================
Installing Whitetrash
=====================

Checkout the code:

  svn co https://whitetrash.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/whitetrash/trunk

The packages you will need (this is an Ubuntu/debian command line, but other distros will be similar) are:

sudo apt-get install \
squid \
python2.4-dev \
mysql-server

You should certainly be able to use another database.  There are only a small number of interactions with the database in the code, and (I think) it is pretty vanilla SQL.

Create a database called 'proxy'.
Run the db_setup script to create the single table.
