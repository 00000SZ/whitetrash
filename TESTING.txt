I have built a suite of tests for use with the "funkload" tester: http://funkload.nuxeo.org/

Currently a patch is required to change the form post encoding, but I have submitted this to the funkload author, so hopefully it will be mainstream soon.  I have included the funkload.diff for the time being.

=================
Running the Tests
=================

Set your proxy environment variable:

  export http_proxy=http://10.10.10.10:3128

To run just one test:

  fl-run-test -d test_whitelist.py whitelist.test_addtowhitelist

To run all the tests:

  fl-run-test -d test_whitelist.py

To benchmark:

  fl-run-bench whitelist.py whitelist.test_addtowhitelist

To build a fancy report:

  fl-build-report --html whitelist_bench.xml


I hope to get some of these reports onto the website soon.
