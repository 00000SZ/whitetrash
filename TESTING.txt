==========
Unit Tests
==========

You should run the tests as the whitetrash user, to prevent any issues with file ownership after the tests have run:

    sudo su -s /bin/bash whitetrash

Django
~~~~~~

To run the Django unit tests:
    python manage.py test

You may want to disable apache caching for testing by putting the following in /etc/apache2/httpd.conf:

    MaxRequestsPerChild 1

To run an individual test:
    python manage.py test whitelist.WhitetrashTestGetForm

Redirector
~~~~~~~~~~

Squid redirector unit tests are also available and can be run with:

    python whitetrash_unittesting.py

To run just the plain redirector tests (no memcached):

    python whitetrash_unittesting.py SquidRedirectorUnitTests

=================
Performance Tests
=================

I have built a suite of tests for use with the "funkload" tester: http://funkload.nuxeo.org/

Set your proxy environment variable to point to your WT-enabled squid:

  export http_proxy=http://10.10.10.10:3128

To run just one test:

  fl-run-test -d test_whitelist.py whitelist.test_addtowhitelist

To run all the tests:

  fl-run-test -d test_whitelist.py

To benchmark:

  fl-run-bench test_whitelist.py whitelist.test_addtowhitelist

Note that you probably want to limit the stack size if you are going to benchmark, so your box can run up enough threads.  Use "ulimit -s 2048".

To build a fancy report:

  fl-build-report --html whitelist_bench.xml

=======
Results
=======

Whitetrash has been shown to scale well, since the code is very small, and the database accesses simple.  Memcached support has been added to support very large scale enterprise deployments.
