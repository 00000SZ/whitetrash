Possibly make a stand-alone version of wt as the ff plugin for when a full wt proxy is not available.  All whitelisted domains just stored in browser settings (essentially no script, but for all traffic, not just script?  Have to think about this more).

Possibly have an option to make per-user whitelist the default, and to add into a system-wide whitelist requires admin approval or CAPTCHA.  Can't think how to do this with current auth system....

Remove added successfully page - just do the refresh straight away with a
301 moved temporarily?  This page is not necessary and just slows things
down.

Replicate performance testing from previous release and compare.  Old text from website below:

<h1>Performance Testing</h1>
<p>
Performance testing has been conducted using the <a href="http://funkload.nuxeo.org">funkload</a> web testing framework.  Testing scripts and configurations are included in the code repository so the testing can be reproduced.  The tests described below were completed with whitetrash running inside a vmware session on a desktop Dual Pentium 3 GHz with 2 GB of RAM, with around 23 000 entries in the whitelist.
</p>
<p>The first test was designed to exercise whitetrash's ability to produce a page for a domain already in the whitelist.  Below are the results from four separate machines making a combined 2000 simultaneous requests for a domain in the whitelist.  The results show this test was easily handled by whitetrash, but producing the page was slow on occassions due to the upstream proxy - these testing sessions actually caused the upstream to crash.</p>

</ul>
<p>
A second test was performed to test whitetrash's ability to add a large number of new websites into the whitelist.  In this test, 400 then 600 new websites were added to the whitelist simultaneously by requesting a new page (GET) and submitting the completed form (POST).  Whitetrash handled this stress, which is representative of a reasonably large organisation since additions to the whitelist should be much less frequent than selects.  See the results <a href="test_addtowhitelist-2007-02-28T16-03-08/index.html">here</a></p> 

<p>Further testing results will be made available here as they are completed.</p>
