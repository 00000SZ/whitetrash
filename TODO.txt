==============
Firefox-Plugin
==============

I intend to write a firefox plugin with a similar interface to 'noscript' that allows users to easily see what sites are being blocked, and quickly whitelist those necessary to load the page.

Per-User Whitelisting
=====================

Possibly have an option to make per-user whitelist the default, and to add into a system-wide whitelist requires admin approval or CAPTCHA.
