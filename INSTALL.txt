=====================
Installing Whitetrash
=====================

Checkout the code:

    svn co https://whitetrash.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/whitetrash/trunk whitetrash

The packages you will need (this is an Ubuntu/debian command line, but other distros will be similar) are:

    sudo apt-get install \
    squid \
    python-dev \
    python-mysqldb \
    python-pyopenssl \
    mysql-server \
    python-django \
    libapache2-mod-python

    cd whitetrash

edit whitetrash.conf:

 - Change all of the database user passwords, these users will be created for you by the installation script

Run the setup script and supply your DB root password:

    sudo python setup.py install --mysql-root-passwd="myrootpassword"

Enable apache ssl and modrewrite modules:

    sudo a2enmod ssl rewrite

Restart apache and squid, start whitetrash_cert:
    /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
    /etc/init.d/squid restart
    /etc/init.d/whitetrash_cert start

Make sure the whitetrash_cert server gets started in the default runlevels by (on ubuntu):

    sudo update-rc.d whitetrash_cert defaults

If you would like to enable the CAPTCHA (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha) test for whitelist additions, you will need to install PyCAPTCHA: http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/PyCAPTCHA/0.4  using easy_install (python-setuptools) and the python-imaging package.

    sudo easy_install http://pypi.python.org/packages/2.4/P/PyCAPTCHA/PyCAPTCHA-0.4-py2.4.egg

Squid Config
~~~~~~~~~~~~

An example config with comments has been installed in /etc/squid/squid.conf, you probably don't need to change anything in here.
If you have a large network, check the performance section below.
This config is for Squid 2.7.STABLE3.  Your original squid.conf is backed up in the same directory.  You may want to use vimdiff on the whitetrash and package conf file to pull in any options from newer versions of squid.

OCSP
~~~~
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2560.txt

Online Certificate Status Protocol checking is enabled on Firefox 3 by default.  This is a problem for whitetrash.  If the ocsp domain in the AuthorityInfoAccess section of a server certificate is not whitelisted, Firefox allows a generous timeout before the page is presented (which, looks to a user like the proxy is really slow).  You can either:

1. Disable it in about:config, security.OCSP.enabled (not recommended)
2. Whitelist all known OCSP domains.  This is done for you in the example squid.conf, although the list may be incomplete.  Searching for "ocsp" in the admin interface to find any missed ones is probably a good idea.

The result
~~~~~~~~~~

netstat -plant should show you the following listeners:

- python (whitetrash_cert)  127.0.0.1:3456
- mysqld                    127.0.0.1:3306
- squid                     0.0.0.0:3128
- apache                    0.0.0.0:80, 0.0.0.0:443

DNS
~~~

Make sure the following domains resolve to the whitetrash IP:

 - whitetrash
 - sslwhitetrash
 - blockedwhitetrash

If you want to have accurate IP addresses recorded in the database, you will need to add in a proxy exclusion
for whitetrash.  If you don't do this, all additions to the whitelist will appear to come from the proxy - ie.
they will have the whitetrash IP.

LDAP
~~~~

To enable LDAP authentication:

    - install the python-ldap package
    - set LDAP_AUTH = "True" in whitetrash.conf
    - change the LDAP entries in django_site/whitetrash/settings.py
    - see django_site/whitetrash/ldapauth.py for documentation on django ldap options 

For troubleshooting, enable LDAP debug in settings.py and disable SSL for LDAP so you can see what is going on.  Check the logs (syslog by default).  If you get stuck, use ipython to manually run the important bits of code from ldapauth.py where it binds to the server (not too complicated).

===========
Performance
===========

Django
------

By default the whole web-interface uses SSL.  If this causes a performance problem you can drop back to HTTP for everything except for the login pages and admin interface by:

 - Removing the rewrite directives from /etc/apache2/sites-available/whitetrash
 - Setting ssl_server_enabled = "False" in whitetrash.conf 

MySQL
-----

If you have a lot of users, you will want to look at tweaking your mysql install, in particular the max number of connections (100 by default).  Set max_connections in my.cnf or test on the commandline temporarily like this::

  set global max_connections=200;

You should probably allocate mysql some more system resources, as the defaults are fairly conservative.  See mysql.com for guidance.

MySQL - memcached
-----------------

To take the load off the database, the whitetrash redirector can use memcached.  Just install cmemcached, and allocate some server memory.
List the memcache servers and enable use_memcached in whitetrash.conf.

To install memcached:

    sudo apt-get install libmemcache-dev libmemcache0 memcached
    wget http://gijsbert.org/downloads/cmemcache/cmemcache-0.95.tar.bz2

    Ignore the patch for libmemcache, you don't need it with the packaged version.

    cd cmemcache-0.95
    sudo python setup.py install

    Customise /etc/memcached.conf

If you see errors like this:

    mcm_server_readable():2587: timeout: Operation now in progress: select(2) call timed out for read(2)able fds

in the squid cache.log, it is memcache hitting its maximum connections limit.  Increase the limit with the -c option in /etc/memcached.conf

System
------

If you have a lot of users, you will have to make the standard system modifications to allow squid to consume lots of system resources, starting with open file handles (to avoid the 'too many open files errors'):

Check /proc/sys/fs/file-max is a suitably large number (on my system it is 304231, which should be enough)
    
    cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max

If you get permission denied errors when setting the ulimit, add these lines to /etc/security/limits.conf (I *think* this requires reboot, but could be wrong)

    whitetrash      soft    nofile         196608 
    whitetrash      hard    nofile         196608

Edit /etc/default/squid (this is probably ubuntu/debian specific, you might find it in /etc/squid/squid.conf):

    SQUID_MAXFD=65536

By default squid will fire up 5 instances of the redirector, you can change this, and if you have many users you will need a lot more.  Note that if you make this a large number you will probably want to increase the maximum number of mysql connections your mysql server will allow (100 by default).  You probably want lots of redirector processes in squid.conf:

    redirect_children 100

You may get complaints about too many connections being tracked, so::

    # This tell you how many sessions arte open right now.
    cat /proc/net/ip_conntrack | wc -l

    # This tells you the maximum number of conntrack entries you can have in total
    cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_conntrack_max

    echo 70000 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_conntrack_max

===============
Troubleshooting
===============

Django complains it can't find settings.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check all directory permissions in the whole path that whitetrash is sitting in.  Directories should be 755, and python files should be readable by all.

I get network timeouts for SSL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check your squid logs, make sure you are resolving sslwhitetrash and blockedwhitetrash.

I get 'Bad request logged'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is usually due to domains not matching the domain regex.  If you use a non-standard internal.dns.name.lan scheme for internal DNS, I suggest whitelisting all internal names ".lan." in the whitetrash.conf file.  You should probably do this for performance anyway.

'Too many open files' errors appear in syslog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See the performance section in this file.

Debugging
~~~~~~~~~

Set DEBUG=TRUE in django_site/whitetrash/settings.py
Change logging levels in whitetrash.conf to DEBUG and restart squid and apache.
