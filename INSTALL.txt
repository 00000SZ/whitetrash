=====================
Installing Whitetrash
=====================

Checkout the code:

  svn co https://whitetrash.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/whitetrash/trunk whitetrash

The packages you will need (this is an Ubuntu/debian command line, but other distros will be similar) are:

sudo apt-get install \
squid \
python2.4-dev \
mysql-server \
apache

You should certainly be able to use another database.  There are only a small number of interactions with the database in the code, and (I think) it is pretty vanilla SQL.

Create and populate a database called 'proxy'.  In mysql::
    
    mysql -u root -p
    create database proxy;
    use proxy;
    source db_setup;
    quit

============
Squid Config
============

You will want to add the following lines to your squid.conf

Cache Peers
~~~~~~~~~~~

#Need to do this to get the auth info passed to my our whitetrash listener
cache_peer whitelistproxy parent 8000 0 no-query no-digest login=PASS 
#This is the domain of the webserver that will serve the static whitelist page
cache_peer viewwhitelist parent 80 0 no-query no-digest 

#Our upstream parent (if any).  If you don't have to go through an upstream proxy you don't need this line.
#cache_peer 10.10.10.254 parent 8008 0 no-query no-digest

Domains
~~~~~~~

#This tells squid to send requests for the whitelistproxy domain to the whitelistproxy cache_peer as above
cache_peer_domain whitelistproxy whitelistproxy
#This tells squid to send requests for the viewwhitelist domain to the viewwhitelist cache_peer as above
cache_peer_domain viewwhitelist viewwhitelist

#I have the viewwhitelist and whitelistproxy domains in /etc/hosts pointing to
#localhost like:
# 127.0.0.1       localhost viewwhitelist whitelistproxy
#You can do the same or use real DNS entries.  If you do the latter you don't need this line.
hosts_file /etc/hosts

Redirector
~~~~~~~~~~

#This is the most important line - tell squid about our redirector
redirect_program /usr/share/squid/whitetrash/whitetrash.py

#By default squid will fire up 5 instances of the redirector, you can change this:
redirect_children 5

Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#You need to turn on authentication, it doesn't matter which method.  For digest I use:
#auth_param digest program /usr/lib/squid/digest_pw_auth /etc/squid/digest_passwords
#auth_param digest children 5
#auth_param digest realm Squid proxy-caching web server
#auth_param digest nonce_garbage_interval 5 minutes
#auth_param digest nonce_max_duration 240 minutes

Access Controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

acl password proxy_auth REQUIRED
http_access deny !password
#Always go through this proxy.  If you have internal web servers might want to make them direct.
never_direct allow all

#Allow the domains that manage the whitelist for us.
acl cgi_server dstdomain whitelistproxy viewwhitelist
http_access allow cgi_server

http_access allow localhost

#let the redirector handle everything else
http_access allow all

#Send everything we don't trust to the redirector to be compared against the whitelist.
redirector_access allow !cgi_server !localhost 

============
Python Files
============

This will install the whitetrash python files into /usr/bin::

    sudo python setup.py install

Run the python webserver (TODO make this an init script)::

    python whitetrash_serve.py

Create a cronjob to generate the html whitelist (modify whitetrash_report.py to
write to your webroot)::

    crontab -e
    0 * * * * whitetrash_report.py

Install apache to serve the static webpage.

==========
The result
==========

netstat -plant should show you the following listeners:

- whitetrash_serve.py 127.0.0.1:8000
- mysqld             127.0.0.1:3306
- apache             127.0.0.1:80
- squid              0.0.0.0:3128
